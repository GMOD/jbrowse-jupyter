If you have issues with the proxy and you are working in jupyter lab, make sure that you have the `jupyterlab-dash` extension installed and you have pip installed `jupyter_server_proxy`. If you get an error when installing it or after installing it, exit jupyter lab then run `$ jupyter lab build` and run jupyter lab again.\n",
